# Just a little reddit

## Update 8/13 - Due to Reddit API changes, this app is currently not functioning. I will be working to get it back up ASAP.

This is a simple Reddit client that allows you to limit the amount of content you will see to prevent neverending scrolling.

Created using React, Redux, and the Reddit API.
